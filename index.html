    <!-- 
    	With the old setup, you had to define these links and scripts on multiple HTML files.
    	With React, they all go here because React only uses one HTML file. Yes, only one!
    	This helps keep things organized and less messy.
    	I noticed you had the same links and scripts in multiple places previously.
    	There were a few situations where you were using old versions because you forgot to update the
      other lines of code in those files. (A couple of times you were trying to use nonexistant paths)
    	NO MORE! ERRORS BEGONE!
